        Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
</p>
<p>
        Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity
        â€” the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, 
        dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets 
        and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of
        planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.
